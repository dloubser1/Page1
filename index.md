## Our Problem of Focus:

With the drastic increase in online and hybrid asynchronous learning students have issues staying focused on what is going on in their classes and are struggling to keep up with the material. While a user’s goal may be to listen in on lessons and they may plan to learn the class content by simply logging in to a call, actually performing the action of listening in is made difficult by the various distractions available through available/on-hand on electronic devices. This means that different students’ results will vary when compared to each other.
